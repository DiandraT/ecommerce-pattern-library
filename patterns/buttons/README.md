The buttons use our accent colour to grab the users attention. There is a significant purpose for all three buttons:

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light colour
- The light buttons are for white or dark background areas because it'll create a nice contrast
- The ghost buttons should be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image

Use the various 'font-size' classes to make different sizes
